## :scroll: Project description

EcoSim is a fascinating real-time ecosystem simulation that puts you in the role of a curious observer of a dynamic world of carnivores and herbivores. Born out of a Python project, EcoSim was entirely rewritten in Go, further optimized and compiled into WASM to bring the simulation to life in your web browser at bsski.github.io.

Witness the intricate dance of life in procedurally generated terrains, where animals endowed with unique traits vie for survival. Analyze the shifting tides of the ecosystem through various statistical charts and indicators, and challenge yourself with a series of achievements designed to add an extra layer of fun and engagement.

Despite some remaining tech debt, the project was launched swiftly to bring this unique experience to you as soon as possible. Future improvements and features are on the horizon, ready to make EcoSim even more immersive and captivating.

## :game_die: How to use

Dive right into the world of EcoSim! Adjust the simulation parameters to steer the course of the ecosystem and achieve your desired outcomes. Controls include the ability to pause, unpause, time travel forward, reset the board, and slow down the simulation. Feel free to tweak the settings even during the simulation - the world is at your fingertips.

## :keyboard: Keybinds

- Space: Toggle pause
- Up arrow/Down arrow: Cycle through achievements
- R: Reset simulation (new terrain & animals)
- T: Skip 8 days
- 123: Change right panel option in the UI.

## :turtle: Animal Traits

Each animal in EcoSim is unique, possessing distinct traits that influence its survival:

- Speed: Determines how frequently an animal moves.

- Legs Length: Influences the efficiency of an animal's movement, potentially reducing energy cost.
- Fat Limit: Sets the maximum energy an animal can store.
- Bowel Length: Defines how much energy an animal retrieves from its food.

Herbivores graze on the spontaneously growing herbs, while carnivores hunt down the herbivores, creating a captivating circle of life.

## :trophy: Achievements

Add a sprinkle of gamification to your EcoSim experience with a system of achievements. Choose an achievement you wish to pursue, fulfill its conditions, and then pick another one! Remember, you have to specify which achievement you're aiming for in order to unlock it. This feature introduces an element of strategy and provides goals that guide your exploration of the ecosystem.

## :rocket: Future Improvements

Although EcoSim is already a fully functional and engaging ecosystem simulation, the journey doesn't stop here. Potential future enhancements include:

- Live automated tests,
- Codebase refactoring to improve efficiency,
- New features such as interval reminders, Leitner system-based flashcards, and more,
- Enhanced UI/UX to provide an even more immersive experience.
